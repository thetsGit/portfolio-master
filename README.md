#### Behind the story
CS50 is pretty popular among young people in Myanmar. And I decided to take this course on Feb 27. During Match I alomst did nothing about it due to my internship's project. But in April, I got a lot of time, especially thingyan and in April 23, I completed my final project and got my certificate in one go.

#### Description

 This is my CS50x2022 final project called portfolioX.
 This is just versioning the existing old funky portfolio website into more engaging real one like by adding new features and sections as well as modifying the existing ones. I once have developed a portfolio website, actually a challenge from front-end-mentor.
 But back then, it was just a mini website filled with fake data, with very little features and sections.
 But I came to need a portfolio website to showcase my portfolio.

## Structures
This website is made up of 8 main sections

- Profile aka About
- Skills
- Education
- Internships
- Certifications
- Languages
- Hobbies
- Projects

In profile section, I've presented an image(Luffy this timexD), my name, email, phone number, a brief about me and social links to linkedin and gihub.
In skills section, I've presented my skills mainly in two sections(frontend and backend) and a brief in others and design sections.
In project section, I've placed my top five favourite projects
- Savannah - online fashion shop
- Healthy - your diet partner
-  Xplore Travel agency website
- Facebit - facebook ui in css3
- CinieBookie - ios cinema booking app)
I personally developed along my journey.

## Highlights
- Navigator
There's the Luffy'head(the navigator) you could find on bottom right corner which will help you to poke around the website very quickly and easily. I've implemented this feature in pure CSS3 for style and used transition and transform attributes for animation
- modeToggler
There's also a button called mode toggler which you could find helpful to toggle modes(dark and light). It's implemented using CSS3 for style and javascript for dom manipulation

## Technologies used:

- MDBootstrap5
- HTML
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- DomApi
- Progress-bar-counter
- AnimeJS

## Possible Improvements
In the future, I would need to expand this website into multiple pages like blogs, work experiences and more likely, to redevelop it using modern stacks like React, Laravel and NextJS.
