#### Description: This is my CS50x2022 final project called portfolioX. This is just versioning the existing old funky portfolio website into more engaging real one like by adding new features and sections as well as modifying the existing ones

#### Understand the website: This website is made up of 8 main sections named (Profile aka About, Skills, Education, Internships, Certifications, Languages, Hobbies and Projects)

### highlights: Navigator(this little compelling luffy head is very handy as u could poke around the website in very efficient way) and modeToggler(to toggle night mode and day mode in one go)

#### techs: I've mainly used mdbootstrap for design but some features like modeToggler and navigator are implemented in CSS3 as u've gusssed as well as some animations 

#### goals: To know me more, To understand me more, To hire me more, yada yada yada

#### Completed: 23th April 2022
