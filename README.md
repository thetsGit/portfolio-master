#### Behind the story
> CS50 is pretty popular among young people in Myanmar. 
> As a consequence, I decided to take this course on Feb 27. 
> During Match I alomst did nothing about it due to my internship's project. 
> But in April, I got a lot of time, especially in Thingyan.
> Accordingly, in April 23, I've completed my final project and got my certificate in one go.

#### Description
 > This is my CS50x2022 final project called portfolioX.
 > This is just versioning the existing old funky portfolio website into more engaging real one by means of adding new features and sections as well as modifying the existing ones. I once had developed a portfolio website, literally as a challenge from the front-end-mentor.
 > But back then, it was just a mini website filled with fake data as well as with very little features and sections.
 > Hence, I came to need a portfolio website to showcase my portfolio, especially my personal projects which can facilitate my career in many ways.

## Project Structures
This website is made up of 8 main sections

1. Profile aka About
2. Skills

8. Projects

## Goals
> To showcase my portfolio

## Highlights
* Navigator
_There's the Luffy's head(the navigator) you could find on the bottom right corner which would help you to poke around the website very quickly and easily. It's implemented in pure CSS3 and used animated in terms of transition and transform css attributes._
* Mode Toggler
_Obviously, just a button called mode toggler which you could find handy to toggle modes(dark and light). It's just implemented in terms of DomApi and CSS3._

## Technologies used:

* MDBootstrap5
* HTML
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* DomApi
* Progress-bar-counter
* AnimeJS

## Possible Improvements
In the future, I would need to expand this website into multiple pages like blogs, work experiences and alike, and more likely to redevelop it using modern stacks like React, Laravel and NextJS.
